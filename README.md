# JavaRepo
A place where I describe how code works with the Java Programming language.

Hello and welcome to this simple guide on how to get started with programming in Java. By now, if you have read my first repository, please check that out first. I assume you already have your IDE ready. I also assume you know how to write a Hello World program as well (again, check the first repo to learn how to do so).

The following README file is similar to my C++ Repo, which you can check out here: https://github.com/Admiral-Kain/CPlusPlusRepo

# Data Types and Data Structures

Like with most programming langauges, Java has a variety of data types that users will need to write their programs in. Here's some basics that you may need.

**int**: Allows users to store whole numbers (integers) on the program (such as 1,2,3, etc.)

**double**: Allows users to store decimal numbers (such as 12.25)

**float**: Similar to double, it can hold decimal numbers. Though the float uses less memory and can hold a 32-bit number instead of 64-bit.

**char**: Allows users to store characters such as 'a', 'b', etc. Note that '2' (in char) does not equal the actual number 2.

**arrays**: An array is a list of elements that begin at 0 and go to MAX - 1. For instance, if you're given an array that carries 5 ints, then the places of that array are labeled as 0-4. Arrays with characters are also known as strings. 

**arraylists**: ArrayLists is a unique data structure to Java, as in you can resize the array, as well as removing and adding elements to said arraylist.

# Methods and Exclusivities in Java

While in C++ and other similar programming languages have functions, in Java, they are referred to as **methods** (which are essneitally the same thing). In addition, each method has to be classified as **public** or **private** as opposed to C++ where you can have functions that are neither. 

Additionally, each method has to belong in a specific **class**, even your main method. Also in Java, it is an object oriented based language (more information on a later repo).

# Conditionals

Conditional statements are useful when it comes to determining the right outcome of one's program. The most popular ones are the if and switch statements.

**if or if else**: Follows a format where if the condition is met or is true (in the parenthesis), then you execute the code. If it is not met or false, then you don't execute the code within that if statement and carry on with your program. Additionally, if there are multiple cases, then else if exists so that if the first one is not true, then go to the else if.

**switch**: A switch statement is similar to the if statement, however has multiple cases for the program to go through. If that is met, you would need to break from that switch statement.

In this repo, I've provided some basic programs that allows you to get to know how to program with the Java Programming Language.
